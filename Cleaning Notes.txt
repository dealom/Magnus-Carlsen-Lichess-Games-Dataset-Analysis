Cleaning Dataset:
•	Replace usernames with real names

o	Remove the empty ‘ply_count’ column
o	Remove the ‘round’ column, it’s all question marks
o	Remove ‘game_id’ column. The ‘site’ column serves as a unique identifier.
o	Remove the ‘file_name’ column since it’s just named after Magnus’s usernames which will be changed to Magnus anyways.

•	There could be a better way to showcase the results of games. I prefer to keep white info on the left side, and black info on the right side, rather than alternating 
Title	Elo Dif	Elo	Name	Result	Name	Elo	Elo Dif	Title

•	The column names have to be unique, so I’ll specify black or white there.
•	The winner, winner_elo, loser, loser_elo columns are just the white, white_elo, black, black_elo columns rearranged. Remove these redundant columns.
•	The ‘group_name_color’ and ‘group_name_result’ shows Magnus’ color and result. I could track his color using another column and change the result column name to ‘Magnus result’ or something similar.
•	The ‘date_played’ and ‘utc_date’ columns are the exact same. Remove the date_played column.
•	Sort games by utc_date. Original data is sorted by username.
